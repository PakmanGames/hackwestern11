Trudeau was overheard pleading, \"Come on, Donald, let's be buddies, eh?

Trump was spotted frantically paddling across Lake Ontario in a gold-plated canoe, desperately seeking refuge from his own tariff threats. Sources say he arrived at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's doorstep, soaking wet and babbling incoherently about the \"yugest mistake\" he'd ever made.\n\nTrudeau, ever the gracious host, invited Trump in for a steaming cup of maple syrup and a crash course in international trade relations. The two leaders engaged in a heated game of hockey to determine the fate of NAFTA, with Trudeau emerging victorious after Trump slipped on his own hair spray.\n\nIn a statement released via carrier pigeon, Trump declared the meeting \"tremendously productive\" and praised Canada's \"beautiful wall of trees\" as inspiration for his own border plans. He also expressed interest in replacing the White House with an exact replica of Trudeau's log cabin, complete with moose butlers and beaver-powered elevators.\n\nAs news of Trump's Canadian escapade spread, Mexico's President Enrique Peña Nieto was reportedly seen building a raft out of sombreros, preparing for his own desperate journey north."},{"headline":"\"Shallow Esophagus\" Remains Anonymous; Retired Bureaucrat Takes Secret to Grave","description":"In a twist of irony, the hunter became the hunted as a former Nixon lackey turned literary dabbler found himself playing detective. His quarry? None other than the elusive \"Deep Throat\" - a nickname that surely raised eyebrows in polite company. \n\nAs our intrepid investigator posed his burning question, the mysterious figure before him squirmed like a worm on a hook. One could almost hear the wheels turning in that shadowy mind: \"Do I confess and risk my neck, or keep mum and risk my legacy?\"\n\nOh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive - or in this case, when we try to unravel decades-old political scandals.

Mark Felt turn whiter than a ghost during grand jury questioning. Felt's poker face was so bad, he might as well have been wearing a t-shirt that said \"I am Deep Throat.\"\n\nPottinger, ever the dutiful bureaucrat, decided to keep this earth-shattering revelation to himself for decades. Because why share information that could rewrite history when you can become a best-selling novelist instead?\n\nIn his final days, Pottinger was reportedly seen furiously scribbling notes, leading many to believe he was finally ready to reveal the secret. Alas, it was just the outline for his next bodice-ripper novel, \"The Bureaucrat's Passion.\"\n\nAs Pottinger takes his secret to the great filing cabinet in the sky, the world is left to wonder: Will we ever know the true identity of Shallow Esophagus, Deep Throat's less talkative cousin?

Reading's for nerds!\"\n\nNow, as he plans his agenda for his twilight years in the White House, Biden has recruited at least a half dozen architects and supporters of the plan to oversee key issues.
