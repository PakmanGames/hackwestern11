Instead, the President-elect seems to have prioritized such outlandish qualities as \"experience\" and \"expertise.\"\n\n\"I know it's unconventional,\" Biden admitted, \"but I thought we'd try something different this time and choose people who actually know what they're doing.\"\n\nThe announcement sent shockwaves through Washington, with pundits scrambling to analyze headshots and wondering how these picks would fare in a swimsuit competition. Some critics have accused Biden of discriminating against the photogenic, arguing that being easy on the eyes is a crucial qualification for navigating complex policy issues.\n\nAs the nation grapples with this radical approach to governance, only time will tell if Biden's gamble on competence over aesthetics will pay off. In the meantime, the White House makeup team has been spotted updating their résumés."},{"headline":"Biden Discovers Unexpected Admiration for Trump's 'Brilliant' Diplomatic Blunders","description":"In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump and Joe Biden have discovered they're actually long-lost twins separated at birth. The world, which had been bracing for chaos, is now watching in bewilderment as the two engage in heartwarming bonding activities like comparing hair plugs and sharing tips on how to confuse reporters with rambling anecdotes. \n\nPolitical pundits are scrambling to explain this unexpected bromance, with some speculating that their shared love of ice cream and tendency to make gaffes has brought them together. Meanwhile, world leaders are unsure whether to be relieved or terrified at the prospect of these two septuagenarians tag-teaming international diplomacy.\n\nAs Trump and Biden plan their first joint rally, tentatively titled \"Make America Slightly Less Divided Again,\" citizens are left wondering if this is the start of a beautiful friendship or just another bizarre chapter in the ongoing political circus.","content":"Biden Discovers Unexpected Admiration for Trump's 'Brilliant' Diplomatic Blunders\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, President-elect Donald Trump is set to revolutionize American foreign policy by turning it into a reality TV show. Sources close to Trump reveal his plans to rebrand NATO as \"The Apprentice: Global Edition\" and the United Nations as \"America's Got Allies.\"\n\nTrump, hailing Biden's foreign policy as \"historically horrible,\" vows to make diplomacy great again by implementing his patented \"Tweet and Retreat\" strategy. Insiders suggest he plans to solve world conflicts through a series of pay-per-view arm-wrestling matches with foreign leaders.\n\nThe President-elect's admiration for autocrats has inspired a new White House initiative: \"Dictators and Chill,\" where he'll bond with authoritarian leaders over hamberders and covfefe. Meanwhile, climate change will be addressed through a groundbreaking plan to cover the polar ice caps with Trump-branded gold leaf.\n\nSurprisingly, Biden finds himself unexpectedly impressed by Trump's unconventional approach. \"It's like watching a bull in a china shop,\" Biden mused, \"if the bull were wearing a red tie and had really small hands.\"\n\nExperts predict that despite the apparent chaos, Trump's foreign policy may inadvertently resemble Biden's, as the sheer weight of global diplomacy forces even the most unpredictable leaders into familiar patterns.

Kennedy Jr. as his health secretary. Kennedy, known for his tireless crusade against vaccines and his ability to find conspiracies in every corner of the medical world, is set to bring his unique blend of paranoia and pseudoscience to the highest levels of government.\n\nInsiders report that Trump was impressed by Kennedy's ability to connect the dots between chemtrails, fluoride in the water, and the secret lizard people controlling the pharmaceutical industry. \"He's got the best brain,\" Trump reportedly said. \"Nobody knows more about health than Bobby. He's read at least three Facebook posts about it.\"\n\nKennedy, for his part, is thrilled to finally have a platform to share his groundbreaking theories on how vaccines cause everything from autism to bad hair days. He's already planning to replace the Food and Drug Administration with a panel of psychics and replace all hospital equipment with healing crystals.\n\nCritics argue that Kennedy's appointment might be problematic, given his lack of medical credentials and his tendency to believe that the Earth is flat. However, supporters point out that at least he's not addicted to anything anymore – except maybe the rush of uncovering imaginary government plots.\n\nAs America braces itself for this new era of health policy, citizens are advised to stock up on tinfoil hats and start practicing their yoga. After all, in the Kennedy-Trump administration, the only prescription you'll need is a healthy dose of skepticism – and maybe some essential oils.","content":"Local Man's Boring Childhood and Lack of Drama Lead to Predictably Dull Political Career\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, John Smith, a 45-year-old accountant from Anytown, USA, has been nominated for the position of Deputy Assistant to the Undersecretary of Watching Paint Dry. Smith's uneventful life and complete absence of scandalous behavior have left political pundits struggling to find anything interesting to say about him.\n\nSmith's childhood was marked by an alarming level of normalcy, with no traumatic events or celebrity relatives to speak of. He graduated from high school with a respectable B average and went on to earn a degree in accounting from a mid-tier state university, where he was known for his punctuality and ability to color-code spreadsheets.\n\nUnlike his more colorful political counterparts, Smith has never been caught with illicit substances, nor has he kept a creepy journal rating women. His marriage of 20 years remains boringly intact, and his most rebellious act to date was forgetting to return a library book in 1998.\n\nPolitical analysts are baffled by Smith's nomination, with one commenting, \"We usually expect at least one juicy scandal or a hint of corruption. This guy's background check was so clean, we thought the file was empty.\"\n\nWhen asked about his plans for office, Smith replied, \"I look forward to serving the American people by ensuring all government-issued staplers are filled to capacity and properly aligned.\"\n\nThe public anxiously awaits Smith's confirmation hearing, where he is expected to bore the Senate committee to tears with his extensive knowledge of tax codes and proper filing techniques."}]
